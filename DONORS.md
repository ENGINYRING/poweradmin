# Donors to the Poweradmin project

As the sole maintainer of Poweradmin, a non-profit project, I work alongside our amazing community of voluntary
[contributors](https://github.com/poweradmin/poweradmin/graphs/contributors). I am deeply grateful for all the generous
donations I receive from individuals, organizations, and businesses. These donations help me keep the project running and
continue its development. Every contribution not only supports the project financially but also encourages me by showing
that people believe in what I'm building.
